# üìà S&P 500 Sector-Based Stock Selection & Risk Analysis

This project explores risk-optimized stock selection from the S&P 500 by identifying top-performing stocks across diverse sectors. The analysis emphasizes consistent return potential, inter-sector diversification, and volatility management using Python and financial data from Yahoo Finance.

## üîç Project Overview

The goal was to simulate a long-term, diversified investment strategy by:

- Analyzing S&P 500 stock performance over time.
- Identifying stable stocks across different sectors.
- Visualizing and evaluating average returns and volatility.
- Selecting 9 stocks from 3 distinct sectors for portfolio consideration.

## üèóÔ∏è Key Components

### 1. Data Extraction

- Pulled daily historical stock data using `yfinance`.
- Filtered stocks from the S&P 500 across multiple sectors.
- Used adjusted closing prices for return calculations.

### 2. Performance Metrics

- Computed daily percentage change for each stock.
- Aggregated to find **mean daily return**.
- Selected top 3 stocks from each of the 3 best-performing sectors.

### 3. Chosen Sectors & Stocks

| Sector       | Selected Tickers         |
|--------------|--------------------------|

| Health Care  | DXCM, PODD, MOH          |
| Real Estate  | CSGP, CBRE, SBAC         |

These stocks were chosen based on their consistently positive mean percentage change over the observation period.

### 4. Visualization

- Created sector-wise bar plots to compare performance.
- Displayed stock selection metrics using formatted data tables.
- Provided clarity on diversification logic.
